    * VAE: framework & overall mathematical idea
    * beta-VAE: framework derivation & disentanglement metric
    * SCAN: disentantglement & hierarchical representation (primitive->concept->relationship)
        * every level implements a different version of VAE
* 1220 Implement Beta-VAE
* 1221 Analyze primitive experiments and write report
* 1222 Analyze the relations between given factors and latent representations z
    * train more epochs(500/1000/2000)
    * draw correlation curves between latent representations and given factors using better model
    * mathematical details of VAE
* to-do:
    * train on more samples
    * implement evaluation of disentanglement metric
    * further about SCAN
