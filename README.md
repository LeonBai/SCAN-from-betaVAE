* 1219 read papers
    * VAE: framework & overall mathematical idea
    * beta-VAE: framework derivation & disentanglement metric
    * SCAN: disentantglement & hierarchical representation (primitive->concept->relationship)
        * every level implements a different version of VAE
* 1220 Implement Beta-VAE
* 1221 Analyze primitive experiments and write report
* to-do:
    * train more epochs
    * draw correlation curves between latent representations and given factors using better model
    * mathematical details of VAE
    * implement evaluation of disentanglement metric
    * further about SCAN
    
    
See `Peiyao_Sheng_beta_VAE.ipynb` for more implementation details.
